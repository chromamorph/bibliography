	Abstract = {Recent studies in the theory of scales by Agmon, Balzano, Carey and Clampitt, Clough and Douthett, Clough and Myerson, and Gamer have in common the central role of the interval cycle. Based on scale features defined in these studies, and an additional feature called distributional evenness defined here, a taxonomy is proposed for pitch-class sets (pcsets) the correspond to interval cycles or to certain conjunctions thereof. Pairwise implicative relationships among the features are explored. Of twenty sets of features that are consistent with these relationships, thirteen are found to be instantiated by actual pcsets and seven others are shown to be incapable of instantiation. Most instantiated feature-sets correspond to infinite classes of pcsets which are shown to be enumerable; one such feature-set is found to be uniquely realized (up to transposition) in the usual diatonic pcset.},
